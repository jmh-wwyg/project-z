# Untitled Marble Game

Untitled Marble Game is an experiment, and the application of several years worth of trying to understand and utilize the 3D functions in Gamemaker Studio 2.
I'm an amateur computer scientist (at best), so it has taken me awhile to get where I am now.
It has been a fun and worthwhile endeavour.

The project files for this game are publicly availble, and this repository is mainly used to log successive versions of the project, and facilitate my need to transfer files from desktop to laptop (and back again) on the regular.

# Untitled Mech Game (umg)

Untitled Mech Game (shorthand umg) is a record of my progress as I take baby steps into creating a game that I've wanted to develop for over 10 years!
I believe I have come to be profecient enough in Gamemaker Studio 2 to realize my dreams, molded by years of playing the N64 as a curious child, endlessly amazed by the boundless magic of 3D computer graphics.

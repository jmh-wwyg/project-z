# Project Z
Project Z is the realization of a machine and mech-fighting video game that I have wanted to create since my childhood. Inspired by the magic and mystique of early 3D computer graphics, I have always wanted to create a game that is approachable, colorful, and most of all, fun!
The visual style draws inspiration from video games like Pilotwings (1990), Star Fox (1993), and Mario Artist: Polygon Studio (2000) as well as from some older anime like Dragon Ball (1986-1989), Sailor Moon (1992-1997), and many of Hayao Miyazaki's films including Castle in the Sky (1986), Kiki's Delivery Service (1989), and Porco Rosso (1992).

The central focus of Project Z is on the mech-fighting, where the player will face off against a wide roster of unique and quirky foes, each with their own machine to match their personalities!
By participating in tournaments, the player will earn money with which they can purchase new assets for their machine.

# Untitled Marble Game
Untitled Marble Game is an experiment, and the application of several years worth of trying to understand and utilize the 3D functions in Gamemaker Studio 2.
I'm an amateur computer scientist (at best), so it has taken me awhile to get to where I am now.
It has been a fun and worthwhile endeavour.

The project files for this game are publicly availble, and this repository is mainly used to log successive versions of the project, and facilitate my need to transfer files from desktop to laptop (and back again) on the regular.

# Untitled Mech Game (umg)
Untitled Mech Game (shorthand umg, conveniently co-opted from the name of its predecessor) is a record of my progress as I take baby steps into creating a game that I've wanted to develop for over 10 years!
I believe I have come to be profecient enough in Gamemaker Studio 2 to realize my dreams, molded by years of playing the N64 as a curious child, endlessly amazed by the boundless magic of 3D computer graphics.
